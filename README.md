# Vastrai Fashion Project

## Problem Statement
The fashion industry is constantly evolving, and customers are looking for innovative ways to try on clothes virtually before making a purchase. Traditional online shopping lacks the ability to visualize how clothing items will look on a person, leading to uncertainty and potential dissatisfaction.

## Solution
Vastrai offers an AI-powered virtual try-on solution that allows users to visualize clothing items on models or themselves. By integrating advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, Vastrai provides a seamless and interactive shopping experience. The platform includes features like:
- Virtual try-on for various clothing items
- A dynamic hero section with promotional slides
- A modern and responsive design with a warm color theme

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Open the application in your browser to explore the features.

## Technologies Used
- React: For building the user interface
- Tailwind CSS: For styling and responsive design
- Axios: For making API requests
- JWT-Encode: For generating JSON Web Tokens

## Future Enhancements
- Add user authentication for personalized experiences
- Expand the virtual try-on feature to include more clothing categories
- Integrate social sharing options for users to share their try-on results
